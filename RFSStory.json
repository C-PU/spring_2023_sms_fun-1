    "story": "The universe is filled with surprises of the unknown. Here is a story of a teenager who lived with his parents and lived a privileged life. Dad was a scientist, an engineer working for the space station. Mom worked in pharmaceuticals. Their house was on a hill, and they were going about their day, just like any ordinary day. A meteor had been brought to attention a few years ago and dad and his co-workers have been on meteor watch because one stray meteor is heading towards Earth. News of the meteor attracted attention, news anchors would give occasional updates of the meteor, while small groups around the world have exclaimed that the end is near. Majority of the population were not worried and continued living their life. Both parents leave to go to work and the player is left alone, on the weekend.",
    "story2": "The teen checks the news, and the news anchor alerts everyone with an important broadcast: “Incoming on Meteor watch, the meteor is directly heading to Earth and is traveling at an indescribable speed. Today is the day that the end is near. During the time of despair, the teenager has not prepared for this moment to come. On the bright side, the parents have prepared, due to their bunker mentality and paranoia. A few years ago, Dad showed the teenager a prototype aircraft, along with supplies for a future voyage into space.",
    "story3": "The teen decided to risk using the prototype aircraft, rather than doing nothing and waiting for the inevitable. The teenager frantically pressing buttons to start up the aircraft, managed to successfully start up and traveled into space. The mixed emotions: of sorrow, pain, relief, and loneliness. The aircraft had enough fuel to send the teenager into space and with the risk of the prototype falling apart, was able to survive the travel. Suddenly, the force of the aircraft changed, and the aircraft had lost control, jostling the teenager in the cabin and a loud clang came from the aircraft, along with a loud thud from the teen. Movement has stopped, curiosity grew. The teen notices a suit in the aircraft and wears it. The suit was a prototype with the aircraft, allowing the user to communicate to aliens, and translate the teenager’s language into any alien language. There were modifications to the suit, such as a general map layout and storage for inventory. More modifications can be added, but the current modifications mentioned is what the teen has for the suit. ",
    "story4": "The teen anxiously opens the aircraft door. A spectacle view of the sky and its vast emptiness with stars. In awe, the expression fades into confusion and despair because the aircraft is destroyed, along with being stranded on a planet with no awareness or having any familiarity of what Earth has. You will be the one to dictate the teenager and be journeying the unknown. You make it a goal to repair the aircraft to explore the unknown.",
    "story_objective": "The planet the player landed on is Earth adjacent. Landforms of mountains, valleys, desert, and jungles are present. The alien planet’s name is A’Pholi. A’Pholi being the ruler of the planet, having top-tier abilities and God-like strength, similarly to Apollo. The objective is to take down A’Pholi and repair the ship by fulfilling quests to repair the aircraft.",
